# Detecting-Diseases-on-beans-using-CNN

Crop diseases are significant yield and growing constraint for the farmers. Identifying symptoms and know when and how to control the diseases has become crucial. The solutions to this may become future of agri-tech business. Here, using Convolutional Neural Network it has been found out if beans have diseases – Angular_Leaf_Spot, Bean_Rust or if healthy.

Beans is a dataset of images of beans taken in the field using smartphone cameras. It consists of 3 classes: 2 disease classes and the healthy class. Diseases depicted include Angular Leaf Spot and Bean Rust. Data was annotated by experts from the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in Uganda and collected by the Makerere AI research lab.

Model – CNN

Evaluation: –

Train set accuracy is 87.43% as compared to Test set accuracy which is 70.31%, it depicts model has some over-fitting.
